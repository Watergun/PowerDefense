# PowerDefense
This project was created as a school project in our IT-Class. It's a Tower Defense game written in Java. Many issues with a proxyserver in our school and other version problems lead to a shutdown of my personal server (on www.kurthen.org), which existed to update this game. Therefore you have to compile the project on your own.
Thank you for your understanding.
